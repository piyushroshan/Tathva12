The objective is to move all the twelve blocks from Zone A to Zone C as early as possible. The team securing maximum points shall be declared as winners in the Phase 1, all those teams moving at least three blocks within the stipulated time will qualify to Phase2. The time limit will be 10 minutes.\n2. At the beginning of the game, the team will have to place their machine in the Start Zone (in Zone A) marked red by one of the team member.\n3. Each team will be given an initial time of two minutes to set up their machine in the arena.\n4. Once a block is picked by the manual machine, if it is dropped anywhere in the arena the block and the machine will be put back to their initial positions. The game will not be paused.\n5. The bot shall not, under any circumstances, cross the white line separating zone B and zone C.\n6. In case of any technical problem with machine it can be resolved and should be placed back to the starting zone in zone A with the current block placed in its initial position, the game won't be paused (the timer will be running), the organizers should be acknowledged before such an action.\n7. Points at the end of the stipulated time will be calculated as:\n\nScore = 300 - (Time taken in seconds) + (no. of blocks transported to platform3) * 100 + (no. of blocks transported to platform2) * 200 + (no. of blocks transported to platform1) * 300.\n\n8. The machines should not leave their respective arenas at any point of time during the game. No part of the machine should touch anything outside the arena during the course of the game.\n9. The machine cannot cause any damage to the block or any part of the arena during the course of the game. If found doing so it will lead to disqualification of the team. Judges hold the right to subjectively evaluate this clause. \n" android:textAppearance="?android:attr/textAppearanceMedium" android:id="@+id/textView3" android:layout_height="wrap_content"></TextView>

This time it is going bigger and bigger with two phases in competition, one for manual machines alone and other a combined version of manual and autonomous machine. To make the competition much more exciting each phase carries its own prize. To take part in the second phase the contestant must qualify in the first phase, or may choose to compete only in the first phase.
