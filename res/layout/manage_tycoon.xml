So, Let the games begin!!!\nPlease send the following details with your answers:\nNAME:\nNAME OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION:\nCONTACT NUMBER:\n1. An electrical engineering graduate from BITS, Pilani, Phani was happy with his Texas\nInstruments job. But seeing the potential of organizing a certain ticketing platform, he\nimmediately brought in partners. He then went to the registrar of companies with the\nidea of calling his company 7D, or \'Seven Dudes\'. The registrar declined this name,\ntelling them a company\'s name cannot start with a number. Finally the proposal to\nname the company Pilani Soft Labs, was accepted in their third visit to the registrar\nwith X being their brand name.What is X?\n2. In 1968, X founded X Ltd., a coat shop in the York Hotel in New York City, with\n$10,000. Legend has it that a year later a buyer from Bonwit Teller got off the elevator\non the wrong floor, and ended up placing a $50,000 order. It is more likely though, that\nX showed his work to Bonwit Teller staff, which led to his first collection: a line of\nmen\'s and women\'s coats featured at the New York City store.In 1969, he, who was\nlater described as quot;the supreme master of minimalism,quot; appeared on the cover of\nVogue magazine. By 1971, sportswear, classic blazers as well as lingerie were\nadded to his women\'s collection portfolio.Which fashion magnate had such an\naccidental and yet such a humble beginning?\n3. You have three boxes full of marbles. There are stickers saying white red red and\nwhite on them indicating what color are the marbles inside the boxes.One day\nsomeone moves the stickers so that none of them is on a correct box. How many\nmarbles do you have to draw to place all stickers correctly again without looking\ninside the boxes?\n4. Prison guards are bored so during dinner they announce the prisoners that they will\nplay a game. In the morning they will stand in a line so that every prisoner will see all\nstanding in front of him but no one behind him. Guards will randomly paint red or\nwhite stripe on their back.They will ask prisoners one by one from the last to the first.\nThey will be allowed to say just one word red or white. If the prisoner says the color\nhe has on his back he may go home in opposite case he will be executed without\ndelay.The prisoners are in one cell during the night and they can discuss the tactics.\nHow can they save maximum number of prisoners?\n5. In 1949, a young entrepreneur, K. M. Mammen Mappillai, opened a small toy balloon\nmanufacturing unit in a shed at Tiruvottiyur, Madras (now Chennai). Although the\nfactory was just a small shed without any machines, a variety of products, ranging\nfrom balloons and squeaking toys to industrial gloves and contraceptives, were\nproduced. Which multi\u00adbillion dollar company had such a humble beginning?\n6. In front of you are 10 bags, filled with marbles. The number of marbles in each bag\ndiffers, but all bags contain ten marbles or more. Nine of the ten bags only contain\nmarbles of 10 grams each. One bag only contains marbles of 9 grams. In addition,\nyou have a balance which can weigh in grams accurate, and you are allowed to use itonly once (i.e. weigh a single time). How can you find out in one weighing, which bag\ncontains the marbles of 9 grams?\n7. You walk upwards on an escalator, with a speed of 1 step per second. After 50 steps\nyou are at the end. You turn around and run downwards with a speed of 5 steps per\nsecond. After 125 steps you are back at the beginning of the escalator. How many\nsteps do you need if the escalator stands still?\n8. His first product was soap. In order to sell the soap, he offered free baking powder.\nThe baking powder became more popular than the soap so he switched to that. To\nhelp sell his baking powder, he began offering something else for free. Well, that\nbecame even more popular then and today he leads in the production of that\nparticular product. Who am I talking about and what product?"
